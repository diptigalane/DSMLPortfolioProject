This project id for building a linear regression model to predict the demand of number of Uber taxis. It aims at correctly predicting the demand of the number of taxis on a particular day at a particular location at a particular time. At present, demand is clustered to a few pick up locations on a few peculiar days. There is uneven distribution of taxis across the locations in the city. This model will help company enhance and optimise their taxi service and drivers usage.
